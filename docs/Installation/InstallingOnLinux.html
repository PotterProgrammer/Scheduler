<h1> Installing Scheduler on a Linux System</h1>
<p >To run Scheduler on a Linux system, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure that Perl is installed on your system.</li>
	<li>Download the Scheduler code to your system.</li>
	<li>Install the needed Perl modules to your system.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<p >Scheduler uses Gmail to send out email notifications to volunteers, and uses Twilio
to send out text messages to volunteers.  If you wish to make use of these features 
</p>
<indented-block>
	<h5 >For Gmail you will need to:</h5>
	<ol>
		<li>Set up a Google account.</li>
		<li>Create a Google project.</li>
		<li>Get the Google API key for that project.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h5 >For Twilio you will need to:</h5>
	<ol>
		<li>Set up a Twilio account.</li>
		<li>Get the Twilio information.</li>
	</ol>
</indented-block>
<br/>

<p >Scheduler runs as a web server.  When it is
running, you should be able to access it from any machine that is on
the same local network as the system where it is running.  If you
wish to be able to access it from outside your office (or allow
volunteers to access it to make updates to their available dates)
then you will need to make your local machine visible on the
internet.</p>
<h3>Make sure that Perl is installed on your system</h3>
<p>Perl is probably already installed on your system, as it is installed by
default on most unix distributions. To see if Perl is installed on your system,
open a terminal session, and at the prompt, type:
<terminal-text> perl -v </terminal-text>
If you see something that starts off like:
<terminal-text> This is perl 5, version 34, subversion 0 (v5.34.0)</terminal-text>
then you have Perl installed on your system.  (The version number doesn't have to match.)</p>
<p>
If, on the other hand, you see something like:
<terminal-text>Command 'perl' not found</terminal-text>
then Perl is not installed on your system, and you need to install it before you
can run Scheduler.</p>
<h4>Installing Perl</h4>
<p>
To install Perl on your system, the recommended method is to use the package
manager associated with your system.  The two most common are <b>yum</b>, which
is used on RedHat based systems, like RHEL, Fedora and CentOs, and <b>apt</b>,
which is used on Debian based systems like Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint.  (It is
worth mentioning that instead of apt, your system might have <b>apt-get</b>
installed.  <b>Apt</b> is a newer version, but <b>apt</b> and <b>apt-get</b> have similar
functionality.)  Note that to use either <b>apt</b> or <b>yum</b> to install
packages, you will either need to be logged in as the root user, or you will
need to run each command using <b>sudo</b>.  The examples here will use <b>sudo</b>.
If you are unsure if your system uses <b>apt</b> or <b>yum</b> you may simply try typing
each command at the command prompt.</p>
<indented-block>
	<h5>Using yum</h5>
	<p>First it is recommended that you update the list of the latest versions
	of software that is stored on your computer.  To do so, open a terminal
	session and type:
	<terminal-text>sudo yum check-update</terminal-text>
	Once that has been done, you can then install the latest packaged version of Perl
	by typing the following:
	<terminal-text>sudo yum install perl</terminal-text>
	This will direct the yum program to download Perl and any additional
	required libraries that are needed by Perl.  Once the packages are
	downloaded they will be installed, along with any of the needed
	dependencies.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Using apt</h5>
	<p>If your system has <b>apt-get</b> installed, you
	may simply substitute "apt-get" for "apt" in these instructions.  Before
	installing a new package, it is recommended that you first update your
	computer's list of available packages and versions.  To do so, open a
	terminal session and type:
	<terminal-text>sudo apt update</terminal-text>
	The system will reach out to other systems on the internet to get a list of
	the latest package versions that are currently available for your system.
	When that is finished, you can then install Perl by typing:</p>
	<terminal-text>sudo apt install perl</terminal-text>
</indented-block>
<h3>Download the Scheduler code to your system</h3>
<h3>Install the needed Perl modules to your system</h3>
<p>In addition to Perl itself, your system will also need to have some
additional Perl modules. Perl modules are reusable components that are not part
of the base installation that make it easier to carry out specific tasks.  The
first step is to make sure you have a Perl tool named <b>cpanm</b>.
<h4>cpanm</h4>
<p>To install the needed Perl modules, you will need to use a Perl tool named
<b>cpanm</b>.  Much like <b>apt</b> or <b>yum</b>, <b>cpanm</b> is a package
manager that handles the work of downloading, testing, and installing Perl
modules.  To see if it is already on your system, open a terminal session
and type:</p>
<terminal-text>cpanm</terminal-text>
If you see something like:
<terminal-text>
	Usage: cpanm [options] Module [...]<br>
	Try `cpanm --help` or `man cpanm` for more options.
</terminal-text>
then it is already installed on your system.  If not, you will need to install
<b>cpanm</b>.
<indented-block>
	<h4>Installing cpanm</h4>
	<p>Installing <b>cpanm</b> is easy, but you first need to see if your system
	includes a <b>make</b> command.  You can do this by opening a terminal
	session and typing:
	<terminal-text>make</terminal-text>
	If you see something like:
	<terminal-text>
		make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.
	</terminal-text>
	then it is already installed.  If not, use either <b>apt</b> or <b>yum</b>
	to install <b>make</b> by typing either:
	<ul>
		<li>sudo apt install make</li>
		<li>sudo yum install make</li>
	</ul>
	as appropriate for your system.</p>
	<p>Once <b>make</b> is installed on your system, you are ready to install
	<b>cpanm</b>.  To do so, in a terminal session, type:
	<terminal-text>
		curl -L https://cpanmin.us | sudo perl - App::cpanminus
	</terminal-text>
	<b>Cpanm</b> should now be installed on your system.</p>
