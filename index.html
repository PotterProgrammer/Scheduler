		Scheduler -- Scheduling software for weekly church volunteer positions
	</h1>
	<p>
		Scheduler is a program written to help manage a list of volunteers and to schedule them for needed positions. 
		The way it works is that first you build a list of the positions that need to be filled each week, for instance four
		people to help with communion, one person to read scripture, two greeters to meet people at the doors, etc.
		Then you build a list of people who have volunteered to serve in certain positions.  Perhaps Mary would be a greeter,
		but would also help with communion, while Tom woud like to read scripture. Then you ask the Scheduler program
		to create a schedule of volunteers for a set of dates, and it automatically finds people to fill each slot.

	<p>Scheduler has the following features:
		<ul>
			<li>Scheduler is accessible via the web, so administrators and volunteers can access it
				from their computers, tablets, or phones at any time.</li>
			<li>Volunteeers have the ability to set dates when they are unavailable, to avoid scheduling conflicts.</li>
			<li>Volunteers can optionally request to serve on specific dates.</li>
			<li>Schedules are generated automatically on request, but can be changed as needed, if conflicts arise.</li>
			<li>Schedules may be printed for any requested date.</li>
			<li>Scheduler allows volunteers to make updates to their own information:
				<ul>
					<li>Name</li>
					<li>Contact information</li>
					<li>Desired positions to serve</li>
					<li>Dates when unavailable</li>
					<li>Specific dates desired</li>
				</ul>
				which lessens the workload on the person responsible for scheduling.</li>
			<li>Scheduler allows sending custom schedules to each scheduled volunteer showing the dates
				when their service is requested and the roles that they will be filling.</li>
			<li>Scheduler can send weekly custom reminders to volunteers to let them know they are scheduled to volunteer</li>
			<li>Scheduler can send notices to volunteers, asking them to update their information (if needed)
				before a new schedule is generated.</li>
			<li>Scheduler uses Google Mail (gmail) to send email at no cost</li>
			<li>Scheduler can (optionally) send SMS messages for scheduling and reminders using the Twilio
				service. (This requires a Twilio account.  Twilio currently has no membership fee and charges
				a small fee for each message sent.)</li>
		</ul>
