		<h1>Scheduler</h1>
		<sub-title>Automated Volunteer Scheduling</sub-title>
	<p>
		At one point, our church was using a subscription based software service to handle
		scheduling the volunteers who assisted with our weekly church services.  I wrote Scheduler to replace 
		the service and provide easier to use software that placed no additional cost on the church.
		We have been using that software for some time now, and I wanted to make this software freely
		available so that other churches could handle their own scheduling more
		easily and without the overhead of paying a third party software vendor
		a monthly subscription.
	</p>
	<p>
		Scheduler is a web based system that can be run on a church PC, or (if you set it up like in our church) 
		you can run it on a dedicated computer called a Raspberry Pi that costs about $50-$80 and is the about the 
		size of a deck of cards.  Currently, Scheduler is set up to run on a Linux system, but work is underway to have
		it run on a Windows PC as well.  (I do not currently have access to a Mac, but it should be fairly easy to
		port to run on a Mac as well, if someone is interested.)
	</p>
	<p>
		To use Scheduler, you begin by building a list of the positions that need
		to be filled each week. For instance, you might need  four people to
		help with communion, one person to read scripture, two greeters to meet
		people at the doors, etc. Then you build a list of people who have
		volunteered to serve in certain positions.  Perhaps Mary would be a
		greeter, but would also help with communion, while Tom woud like to
		read scripture. Once positions and volunteers have been entered, you
		simply ask the Scheduler program to create a schedule of volunteers for
		a set of dates, and it automatically finds people to fill each slot.
		The schedule can be viewed online or printed, and volunteers can be
		notified of their individual schedules.
	</p>

	<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
	<p>Scheduler has the following features:
		<ul>
			<li>Scheduler is accessible via the web, so administrators and volunteers can access it
				from their computers, tablets, or phones at any time.</li>
			<li>Volunteeers have the ability to set dates when they are unavailable, to avoid scheduling conflicts.</li>
			<li>Volunteers can optionally request to serve on specific dates.</li>
			<li>Schedules are generated automatically on request, but can be changed as needed, if conflicts arise.</li>
			<li>Schedules may be printed for any requested date.</li>
			<li>Scheduler allows volunteers to make updates to their own information:
				<ul>
					<li>Name</li>
					<li>Contact information</li>
					<li>Desired positions to serve</li>
					<li>Dates when unavailable</li>
					<li>Specific dates desired</li>
				</ul>
				which lessens the workload on the person responsible for scheduling.</li>
			<li>Scheduler allows sending custom schedules to each scheduled volunteer showing the dates
				when their service is requested and the roles that they will be filling.</li>
			<li>Scheduler can send weekly custom reminders to volunteers to let them know they are scheduled to volunteer</li>
			<li>Scheduler can send notices to volunteers, asking them to update their information (if needed)
				before a new schedule is generated.</li>
			<li>Scheduler uses Google Mail (gmail) to send email at no cost</li>
			<li>Scheduler can (optionally) send SMS messages for scheduling and reminders using the Twilio
				service. (This requires a Twilio account.  Twilio currently has no membership fee and charges
				a small fee for each message sent.)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2 id="installing">Installing Scheduler</h2>
	<p>
		To set up Scheduler to run and be accessible via the web, you will need to:
		<ul>
			<li>Install the Scheduler software on a computer that has access to the internet.</li>
			<li>Provide a link from the internet to the computer where Scheduler is running.</li>
		</ul>
		Technically, the last step is not required, but without it, Scheduler
		will only be accessible from the location where Scheduler is installed.
		To be able to run it remotely or have volunteers access it from home,
		the last step is needed.
	</p>
	<h3>Installing Scheduler on a computer</h3>
	<p>
		Currently Scheduler may be installed on the following platforms:
		<ul>
			<li>Linux PC</li>
			<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
		</ul>
		Though the installation methods are different for each, they each will be installing from the same code.
		Details for installing on each platform are listed below.
	</p>
	<h4 id="linux_pc">Installing on Linux PC</h4>
	<p>
		To install Scheduler on a Linux machine, you will need to use an
		account that has <b>sudo</b> privelege so that you can install the
		needed pieces, if they are not already on your system.  Begin by making a directory
		to store the Scheduler program and its needed files.  For instance
		<command-line>mkdir Scheduler</command-line>
		Next, download the Scheduler software from github using <a href="https://github.com/PotterProgrammer/Scheduler/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">this link</a>. 
		Once the file is downloaded, you will need to unzip the contents of the file and place
		them in the directory that you just created.  Note that the .zip file
		that github builds places everything under a folder with the name of
		the repository and the branch (in this case, "Scheduler-main").  It is
		the contents of the Scheduler-main directory that we are interested in.
		Once you have extracted the contents of the .zip file, change to the
		directory where the code is located. The contents of the folder should
		look something like this:
		<pre>
BuildSchedule.pm  email         public          sms
cpanfile          Installing    SaveRestore.pm  startup_scheduler.cfg
Dockerfile        LICENSE       Scheduler       templates
docs              Messaging.pm  Session.vim
			</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		To install the needed system components, switch to the
		<b>Installing</b> directory. By default, the Scheduler web server
		listens to port 3000 for incoming connections.  If you would prefer to
		use a different port number, you can supply it when running the install
		command.  Type either
			<command-line>./linux_install.sh</command-line>
		to install Scheduler to listen to the default port of 3000, or
			<command-line>./linux_install.sh <color-blue>##</color-blue></command-line>
		where <b>##</b> is the port number you wish to use instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		The program will begin by making sure that your system has the pieces
		needed to run the Scheduler on your system. The script uses <b>sudo</b> 
		to install the components, and so sudo will ask you to enter your password
		before it starts installing the needed pieces.  It will install some developer
		related pieces like "make", the C++ compiler, and the Perl, as well as few system libraries.
		Then, the script will install the Perl modules needed by Scheduler, if they are
		not already on your system.  Finally, it will set up the <b>startScheduler</b>
		script, which you will use to start Scheduler, and it will setup your
		system to automatically launch Scheduler each time your system reboots.
		Depending on your system and internet speed, this may go very quickly
		or might take significantly longer.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the script ran without errors, Scheduler is now installed on your system.
	</p>
	<h2>Running on a Raspberry Pi</h2>
	<p>
		Running Scheduler on a Raspberry Pi provides a means of running the
		scheduler program on a computer that has low power requirements and
		takes up very little space.  Raspberry Pi computers typically use 13 -
		25W of powerâ€”about the same as charging a cell phone. PCs and Macs on
		the other hand may use hundreds of Watts.  Since the Raspberry Pi is
		about the size of a deck of cards and only weighs a few onces, it is
		very unobtrusive.  By running the Scheduler software on a Raspberry Pi,
		you can easily and inexpensively leave it running 24-7 as a dedicated
		service.
